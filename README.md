###How to Create a new Card: (You don't need to be a pro)
Open the file: js/cards.js 
A new Card Object need these attributes: 
<ul> 
<li> headline: string</li>
<li> content: string (-> Content of card)</li>
<li> showsettings: (true:if the card has settings, 'plus' if it need a plus to add sth. and false if nothing of the two. </li>
<li> permission: string (if the card needs extra permission -> declare it in manifest!)</li>
<li> origin: string (if the card needs extra origin -> declare it in manifest!)</li>
<li> init: function: this function happens everytime the page get loads and the card is init.</li>
<li> optional if the card has settings or plus: you need the both functions settings (this will happen if the user click on the gear or plus, and the function apply will run if the user apply.</li>
</ul>
Watch out the the cards file! There are examples for everything you will need.

###How to add your language! 
<p> 
	Create a new directory in _locales with the language shortcut from the language you're going to add. Copy the file "messages.json" from the english directory, and translate all the strings into your language. And now: enjoy myTab in your own language! :)
